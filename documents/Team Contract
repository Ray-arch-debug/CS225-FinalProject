# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
The meetings will be hosted twice a week, once in-person in Daniel's Hall and once on discord on the following friday just to catch up and make sure we get through what we needed to get through. Aakash will take in person meeting notes and the discord calls will also be sumarized by Aakash. 
2. **Assistance** 
Our team is using a discord server in order to make these conversations easier, furthermore meeting in person is also being enforced. The discord server is our primary source of conversation but we will also be using Snapchat and text to hold private in group conversations as needed.
3. **Respect** 
Our team is very good at giving everyone a chance to present their ideas and is supportive of other people's ideas, the coolection of notes and the constant emphasis in teamwork will be reinforced by the notetaker to further develop this already respectful environment. 

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
The work distribution will be based on the amount of work finished and our deliverables will be split in parts where each member will focus on different aspects of the project to make sure it is delivered on time. We do not believe in boundaries or our work system, we will work on other parts of project together if we finish our parts. We have split the project into multiple parts, research, data analysis, algorithms and post analysis and we will use these to split our work in multiple parts and work across each as a team. 
5. **Time Commitment** 
Our group has decided that it is crucial that we each spend about 4 hours outside of our regular meeting times in order to make progress on the project. We have discussed the possibility of time commitement and made up a convinenient time to meet up. However, the group work is worked on remotely while, we will use the discord server to discuss the problems which arise. We have made the server to have serveral functionalities which make our lives easier in term of keeping our communications clear which should improve efficienct and help us resolve time conflicts. 

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
Our group is very tolerative of understanding other parties problems, we will enforce and expect everyone to present the team with viable reasons for being late and this will be handled by the note-taker (manager) of the group. We will also be patience but very strict about our deadlines within the group, however, we will also make concessions and work together when facing difficultites regarding the project portions. We also realize that we have a official mentor for this project who we will reach out to when we find ourselves at odds with each other.
